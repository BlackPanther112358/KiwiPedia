# KiwiPedia
An Informal Wikipedia

This is our attempt to make a more informal version of Wikipedia, The Kiwipedia, which will not only provide a brief summary on topic (fetched from one and only Wikipedia, but also the memes and latest memes

Our plan was to make a website, which will be able to search internet using relevant API's and gather all the required information. But due to lack of expertise (and maybe time) we were only able to implement the same for only few options as proof-of-concept

The user will be guided to the homepage of our website where he/she will be able to search (from , currently, few available options) and he can search (select) the one he/she desires. The webpage for the topic will then load

We are using Reddit API for getting the memes from required subreddits, News API for latest news and WikiData API for the short description of topic.

The following project has been made by Aakarsh Jain and Abhay Chawdhary.
